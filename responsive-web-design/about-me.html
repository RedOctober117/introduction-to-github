            <p>If you were ever in an advanved English class, probably read the Illiad and/or the Odyssey. My class read it in 8th grade, and I was immediately intrigued by the name of Odyssey's son, Telemachos. It was a name I had not seen used before as a screen name, and I liked it, so I took it. In an effort to help people unfamiliar with the term pronounce it, I changed the spelling, hoping that it would be much clearer how to say "Telemachos". It's not. It didn't work at all. So, instead of being "Telem" - "akos", I'm called "Tele" - "makos".</p>
