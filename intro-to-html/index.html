    <h3>Recreating the Void</h3>
    <p>This is a recreation of <a href="https://void.telemakos.io" target="_blank">https://void.telemakos.io</a> where I host short stories I write for Dungeons and Dragons. Below will be snippets from two that I have written so far. The full versions are on void.telemakos.io, of course.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://void.telemakos.io/perens-tin-clock/" target="_blank">Peren's Tin-Clock</a></h4>
    <p>The inn, situated on the outer edge of the Fourth Ring, faces the center of the Rheasilvia. A garden surrounds the inn and extends out in front, wrapping around a fountain, topped with a regal dragon etched of obsidian. Peren recalls seeing similar statues dotted throughout the city. Beyond the fountain runs the main road, a cobbled and clean path. A breeze comes to pass, cool on his skin, but warm for the flowers around him. Even in the middle of summer, the wind and the early dawn conjure an image of late autumn at home.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://void.telemakos.io/a-swing/" target="_blank">A Swing</a></h4>
    <p>Numerous measures are taken before the launch of a comet, and for good reason. Comets are specially designed for their destination biome. Some leeway is provided courtesy of the Terramancers, but the margin is slim. The host planet is observed for a millennia before it is put in the final candidate pool. It is vital that its orbit, and its system's orbit, are conducive to the long-term survival of the Comet. A great deal of effort is put into picking the exact location for landing, because while Terramancers are good, they aren't gods. </p>

    <p>Rheasilvia will have roughly four major colleges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The College of Attrition and Tactics, spearheaded by Rivaan Uttara</li>
      <li>The College of Terramancy</li>
      <li>The College of the Arcane</li>
      <li>The College of Wyvern Bio-Engineering</li>
    </ul>
